================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The log indicates a deletion of credentials with a specific ID (497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08). While no explicit vulnerability is detected, if proper access controls are not in place, this could potentially allow unauthorized users to delete credentials.
Solution: Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can delete credentials. Consider using role-based access control (RBAC) or access control lists (ACLs). Also, ensure that all actions are logged for audit purposes.
