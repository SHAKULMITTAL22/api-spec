# Vulnerability: Potential Sensitive Data Exposure
# Issue: The log entry indicates a DELETE operation on a credential resource. If not properly authorized and logged, such operations could lead to unauthorized deletion of sensitive data. The issue is located at the line with timestamp [5:05:35 AM]
# Solution: Ensure that all operations on sensitive resources are properly authorized and logged. Use secure audit logs to track who is making these requests. Keep these logs in a secure location to prevent tampering. Implement backup strategies to recover from unintended deletion of credentials.
