# Vulnerability:Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
# Issue: The log indicates a deletion of credentials with a specific ID (497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08). While this doesn't directly reveal sensitive information, it could be a potential issue if the identifiers are guessable or predictable. This could lead to unauthorized access if an attacker guesses or predicts the ID. Log line: [5:05:35 AM] › [HTTP SERVER] delete /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 ℹ info Request received
# Solution: Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized users from performing sensitive operations. Also, consider using unpredictable identifiers.
