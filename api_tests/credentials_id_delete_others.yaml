Vulnerability:Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: The log reveals a DELETE request to a /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 endpoint. This could be an exposure of sensitive data as it appears to be a UUID, potentially associated with sensitive data.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information like UUIDs, user IDs, or other potential identifiers. If necessary for debugging, consider using a secure, hashed representation.
