================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The log indicates a deletion of credentials with a specific ID (497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08). While no explicit vulnerability is shown, if proper access controls are not in place, this could potentially allow unauthorized users to delete credentials. This is observed in line: [5:05:35 AM] › [HTTP SERVER] delete /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 ℹ  info      Request received
Solution: Implement strict access control measures. Ensure that only authorized users can delete credentials. Also, use indirect references instead of actual IDs to prevent exposure of direct references to internal implementation objects. Logging the identity of the user making the request could also be beneficial for audit purposes.
