================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Potential Unauthorized Access Attempt
Issue: Multiple GET requests were made to the /credentials endpoint. This could potentially be an attempt to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Logs: Line 1, Line 3
Solution: Ensure appropriate access control measures are in place for the /credentials endpoint. Monitor this endpoint for repeated failed access attempts and consider implementing rate limiting or temporary IP blocking for repeated failed attempts. Additionally, logs should be enhanced to include the status code of the response to these requests, which can provide more information about whether these attempts are successful or not.
