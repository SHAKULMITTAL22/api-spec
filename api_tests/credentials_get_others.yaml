================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Potential Unauthorized Access Attempts
Issue: Multiple GET requests to /credentials endpoint. This could potentially be a sign of unauthorized access attempts, though there is not enough information provided to confirm this.
Solution: Monitor logs for repeated failed access attempts, consider implementing rate limiting or CAPTCHA to prevent brute force attacks, and ensure that appropriate access controls are in place.
