================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: Credentials are being requested and potentially exposed. This is evident from the log entries on lines: 2, 3, 4.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data such as credentials are properly protected with encryption during transmission and at rest. Implement access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Vulnerability:Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The log entry on line 3 shows a GET request to a specific credential ID. This could be an instance of IDOR if the ID is exposed to the user and not properly protected.
Solution: Implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized users from accessing data. Use indirect references to objects instead of their actual database keys.

Vulnerability:Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Issue: The logs provided do not include enough information to identify or investigate potential security incidents. For example, there are no entries related to authentication attempts, IP addresses of the requests, or error messages.
Solution: Enhance logging to include more detailed information about each request. This should include IP address, user agent, timestamps, and the result of the operation (success or failure). Monitor the logs regularly to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
