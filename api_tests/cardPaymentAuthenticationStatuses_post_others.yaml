# Vulnerability: PCI Data Exposure
# Issue: Credit card numbers are being exposed in the logs (lines 1 to 5). This is a violation of PCI DSS requirements and can lead to data theft and misuse.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive PCI data. If logging is necessary for business requirements or troubleshooting, ensure the data is anonymized or tokenized. Also, restrict access to logs and ensure they are securely transmitted and stored.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-Compliance
# Issue: The logs contain sensitive information (credit card numbers) that could be tied back to individuals, violating GDPR principles (lines 1 to 5).
# Solution: Ensure no personal data is logged unless absolutely necessary. If personal data must be logged, it should be pseudonymized in accordance with GDPR guidelines. Regularly audit your logs to ensure compliance.
