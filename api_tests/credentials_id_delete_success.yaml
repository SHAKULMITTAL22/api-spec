================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Sensitive Operation Disclosure
Issue: The log entry discloses that a delete operation on credentials was performed. This can be a potential information disclosure vulnerability if the logs are accessed by unauthorized users. The issue is found in the log line '[HTTP SERVER] delete /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08'.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive operations or information that can be used by an attacker to understand the system. If such logging is necessary for debugging or other purposes, ensure that the logs are properly protected and can only be accessed by authorized personnel.
