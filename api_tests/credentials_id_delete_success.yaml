================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The log indicates a deletion of credentials with a specific ID (497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08). While this doesn't directly reveal a vulnerability, it could potentially be exploited if an attacker can manipulate these references. Log line: [5:05:35 AM] › [HTTP SERVER] delete /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 ℹ  info      Request received
Solution: Implement access controls such as requiring authentication and authorization checks before allowing the deletion of credentials. Also, consider using indirect references instead of direct references to objects.
