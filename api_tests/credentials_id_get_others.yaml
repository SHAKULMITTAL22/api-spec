Test generated by RoostGPT for test api-test using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The log entry shows a GET request to /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 endpoint. If not properly secured, this could expose sensitive information such as user credentials. No line number is provided in the log.
Solution: Implement proper access control checks before serving requests to sensitive endpoints. Validate the request to ensure that the client is authorized to access the requested credentials. Consider using an access control mechanism such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Access Control Lists (ACLs).
