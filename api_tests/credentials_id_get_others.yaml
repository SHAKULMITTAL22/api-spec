Vulnerability:Information Exposure Through Sent Data (CWE-201)
Issue: API endpoint '/credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08' is exposed in the logs. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access if the logs are compromised.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as API endpoints. If required, ensure logs are properly secured and access is strictly controlled. Implement a log masking or log redaction solution to prevent exposure of sensitive data in logs.
