Vulnerability:Potential Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The log shows a GET request to a /credentials endpoint with a UUID. If permissions are not properly checked, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Log line: [5:05:22 AM] › [HTTP SERVER] get /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 ℹ  info      Request received
Solution: Ensure proper access controls are in place. Implement checks to verify the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested data. Also consider obfuscating or encrypting sensitive identifiers in URLs.
