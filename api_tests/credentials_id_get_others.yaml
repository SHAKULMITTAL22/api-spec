# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
# Issue: The log entry shows a GET request to /credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08 endpoint. If not properly secured, this could expose sensitive information. The problem occurs on log line 1.
# Solution: Ensure that proper authorization checks are in place before serving data from the /credentials/ endpoint. Also, consider implementing an Access Control List (ACL) for all routes that serve sensitive information.
