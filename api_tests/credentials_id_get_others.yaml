Vulnerability:Potential Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: A GET request to the /credentials/ endpoint was detected in the log entry. If proper access controls are not in place, this could potentially expose sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints. Implement an access control check or other server-side mechanism to verify the user's permissions before serving the request.
