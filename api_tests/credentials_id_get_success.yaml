# Vulnerability: Information Disclosure
# Issue: API endpoint '/credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08' is exposed in logs which could potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access. This issue is detected in the provided log entry.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information including API endpoints. Implement proper logging mechanisms where sensitive information is either encrypted or completely excluded from the logs. Also, ensure access to logs is restricted and logs are regularly monitored for any suspicious activity.
