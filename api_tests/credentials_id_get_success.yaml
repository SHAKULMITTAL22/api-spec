Test generated by RoostGPT for test api-test using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Information Exposure Through Sent Data (CWE-201)
Issue: The log entry reveals the server's internal routing information, specifically a GET request to '/credentials/497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08'. This could potentially be used by an attacker to map the internal structure of the server. The issue is located in the log entry line.
Solution: It is recommended to mask or generalize the details of internal routes in the logs. Instead of logging the full path, consider using a hashed or scrambled version of the path. Be sure to keep the original path in a secure, separate location for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.
